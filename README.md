C_Arnoud's_Calibrated_Detector  
======================  
  
This is a method to improve the performance of pedestrian detectors using camera calibration.  
My C++ version of the Dóllar method is used for calculating the feature pyramid and classifying patches.    
Created by Charles Arnoud, under the mentorship of Cláudio Rosito Jüng and with the help of Gustavo Führ.  
  
  
Current Status  
======================  
  
Detection working and it is faster than the original Matlab version, although results seem to be slightly worse.   
Calibrated detection and feature pyramid online, new candidate generation method is done.  
  
  
To Do List:  
======================  
  
Current Total: 2    
  
Project:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test possible uses for the OpenMP library  
  
Calibrated Detection:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improve the rule for calculating overlap between bounding boxes
