C_Arnoud's_Calibrated_Detector  
======================  
  
This is a method to improve the performance of pedestrian detectors using camera calibration.  
My C++ version of the Dóllar method is used for calculating the feature pyramid and classifying patches.    
Created by Charles Arnoud, under the mentorship of Cláudio Rosito Jüng and with the help of Gustavo Führ.  
  
  
Current Status  
======================  
  
Detection working and it is faster than the original Matlab version.   
Calibrated detection and feature pyramid online, new candidate generation method is providing good results.
